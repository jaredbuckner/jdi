===== Jared's Draw Interface =====

While learning SDL2 I was frustrated at the manual management of it all.  So I wrapped a bunch of bits in C++ to make it easier for me to manage windows and sounds and sprites and text in ways I find useful.  If you find it useful too, that's fine by me.

I plan to choose a license in the future.  Something like use-with-attribution.  If you want to use it for commercial purposes and you need a proper license, contact me at jaredbuckner@gmail.com and I'll get around to putting together a proper license file for you.

--- How to build and test ---
